# Real-Time Hand Gesture Detection

This module implements a real-time hand gesture detection system using
computer vision techniques. The system detects hand landmarks from live
camera input and visualizes them in real time.

## Description
The application captures video from a webcam and processes each frame
to detect hand landmarks using MediaPipe. OpenCV is used for frame
processing and visualization. The implementation runs locally using
VS Code.
