# Email Spam Detection Using Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)

This module implements an email spam detection system using a
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN).

---

## Description
The system classifies emails as spam or not spam based on textual data.
Text preprocessing and feature extraction are applied before training
the neural network model. The implementation was done using Google
Colab.
