# Image-Based Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN

## Academic Project | Second Year

This module focuses on recognizing hand gestures from image data using
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## Description
Hand gesture images were collected and preprocessed to create a custom
dataset. A CNN model was designed and trained to classify different
hand gestures. The implementation and training were performed using
Google Colab.
